This module covers 2D human pose estimation using OpenCV's deep learning module (`cv2.dnn`) and a pre-trained Caffe-based OpenPose model. It detects 15 key body joints and draws a skeleton over the input image.

This is the final standalone module before jumping into project-based learning.

---

##  What This Repo Contains

- `pose_estimation.py` — full Python script version of this module
- A Colab notebook link to run it interactively (below)
- Sample image(s) to test the model
- Cleanly structured code with inline comments and markdown explanations

Everything needed is included in this repo **except** the Caffe model file — linked below.



##  What You'll Learn

- What pose estimation is and how it's applied in computer vision
- How to preprocess images using `cv2.dnn.blobFromImage()`
- How to use OpenCV with a pre-trained Caffe model
- How to extract and threshold confidence maps
- How to connect keypoints into a human skeleton overlay

##  End of Line

That’s it.  
Not just the end of Module 13  but the **final checkpoint** of the whole OpenCV course.

We began with raw pixels, blurred some faces, warped a few perspectives, drew stickmen on still images, and learned how to make machines see  or at least pretend to.

And now? You’re not reading a tutorial anymore.  
You’re standing at the edge, looking at *what you can build next*.

OpenCV, these notebooks, the models, the code  it’s all here because people shared what they knew.  
Open source isn’t just about free code  it's about **lowering the entry barriers**. For devs like me. Like you. For anyone with more curiosity than compute.

Because **not everything has to be monetized**, and not every lesson needs a paywall.  
Helping others climb is still the best kind of version control.

See you beyond the matrix.
